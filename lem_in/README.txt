This program takes a certain type of input and simulates ants traveling in network. Only one ant can be present per node. Knowing the constraints, need to bring all ants from START to FINISH by avoiding bottlnecks as much as possible. This program is inspired BFS (Breadth For Search) and Edmonds Karp algorithms in order to solve this flow network problem. You may find input files in "utils" and launch the visualizer with -v (in SDL).
